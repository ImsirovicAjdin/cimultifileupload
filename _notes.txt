Using print_r on the $data['posts'] array
=========================================

We'll print_r the ($data['posts']) array - it will show above the navbar.

Maybe the db is empty, and thus we can't print_r($data['posts']), so:

Write sql query to paste 2 posts into the database:

	INSERT INTO `posts` (`id`, `title`, `slug`, `body`, `created_at`)
	VALUES
	(
		NULL,
		'Post One',
		'post-one',
		'Lorem ipsum dolor sit consectetur adipiscing elit',
		CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
	),
	(
		NULL,
		'Post Two',
		'post-two',
		'Ne obra se bostan dok sljive ne popadaju',
		CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
	)

How does the $data variable behave?
===================================

It seems that the $data variable inside a controller (like Posts.php), takes
one array member, 'post' in this case; We can print_r it from inside the controller. But in a view, the $data
variable is unknown, unavailable. Instead, we have the $post variable, and we can print_r the $post variable. In the 
next commit, I'll rename the $data['post'] = ... to $data['whatevs'] in the CONTROLLER, then try to print_r $whatevs in the view,
to see what happens
